            We're singing a sad song
            All out of tune
            We're playing some bad notes
            We howl at the moon

            So let us talk falsely
            The hour is late
            And though the fruit has ripened
            We'll choose to still wait

CHORUS      Underneath the silver moon
            Branches searching the sky
            Elm tree sings to the stars
            My love passed me by

            In a little sheltered garden
            We sit on cold stone
            And though we're together
            We're so all alone

            I tilt my head upwards
            And choke back the tears
            My back against it
            I feel the old tree's fears

            (Repeat chorus)
