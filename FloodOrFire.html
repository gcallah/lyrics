        <b>Verse 1</b>
        <br />
        Every hour
        <br />
        The flames gettin' higher
        <br />
        I'm caught in a trance
        <br />
        By the beauty of the fire
        <br />
        Every day
        <br />
        As I feel it draw near
        <br />
        I know I should run
        <br />
        But I just stay here
        <br />
        What I need is water
        <br />
        What I want's gasoline
        <br />
        'Cause either flood or fire
        <br />
        Leave the whole place clean
        <br />

        <br />
        <b>Chorus</b>
        <br />
        Flood or fire
        <br />
        Flood or fire
        <br />
        You run for the rocks but the rocks gonna burn
        <br />
        You run for the water but the water gonna churn
        <br />

        <br />
        <b>Verse 2</b> --
        <br />
        Every nerve
        <br />
        So damn exposed
        <br />
        My whole body tingles
        <br />
        Like it's gonna explode
        <br />
        Every heartbeat
        <br />
        Poundin' like a drum
        <br />
        I stare at the sky
        <br />
        Pray the rain's gonna come
        <br />
        What I need is water
        <br />
        What I want's gasoline
        <br />
        'Cause either flood or fire
        <br />
        Leave the whole place clean
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Repeat Chorus</b>
