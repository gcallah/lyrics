You can run for a long time
You can run for a long time
You can run for a long time
Sooner or later Jah cut you down
Sooner or later Jah cut you down

Go tell that long tongue liar
Go tell that midnight rider
Go tell that dirty back biter
Sooner or later Jah cut 'em down
Sooner or later Jah cut 'em down

You can't grab mercy at the point of a gun
Jah-Jah child you gonna come undone
You can't ride the train if you won't pay the price
Tryna steal the ticket won't turn out nice

You can run for a long time
You can run for a long time
You can run for a long time
Sooner or later Jah cut you down
Sooner or later Jah cut you down

Go tell that long tongue liar
Go tell that midnight rider
Go tell that dirty back biter
Sooner or later Jah cut 'em down
Sooner or later Jah cut 'em down
